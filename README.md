## About
The project is aimed at creating a compiler "Oberon-07" for the .Net
platform. Theoretically, it should compile under.
Mono.
Also, this version of Ober0n-07 will support multiple national
languages through a language settings file.
This is the first phase of the compiler, the project is being developed 
for VisualBasic for .Net (vers 4.5).
The second phase of the compiler will be rewritten on Oberon-07 itself.
